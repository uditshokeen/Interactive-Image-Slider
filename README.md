# Interactive-Image-Slider
An interactive image slider is a web component that allows users to view a series of images in a sliding format, with navigation controls (like next/previous buttons) or autoplay. It is commonly used for image galleries, product showcases, and promotional banners. Key features include smooth transitions, responsiveness, touch support, and navigation indicators. Sliders are typically built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be enhanced using libraries like Slick or Swiper. They provide a dynamic way to display multiple images without overcrowding the page.
